    "\n",
    "To install a package that you know the name of (for instance, numpy), simply go to the command line and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we don't know the name of the package, so we need to search it. While Google is helpful, pip also includes a search function. Say I want to install OpenCV, the computer vision library, but I don't know the exact package name. I can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip search opencv\n",
    "```\n",
    "and among the results will be ```opencv-python```, which is the package.\n",

    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing packages in your script\n",

    "```\n",

    "* Running the code with an input that will produce a known output. Going back to our simple mod code, you can try running it with various parameters that you know the answers to, then checking to see if it gives you the answer you expect\n",
    "* Try to understand the error code. While error codes can be dense, they will often tell you the line number at which your code broke. You can often google the error code and get a lucid discussion of what went wrong\n",
    "* Try the aformentioned technique of putting print statements in your code, and using ```python -i <your_script>```. \n",
    "* Search Stack Overflow and other code sites\n",
    "* Use a debugger \n",

    "This is more of an advanced topic, but it fits well with debugging. Unit testing is a way to guarantee high code quality. The philosophy behind unit testing is to write a bunch of tests that try to break your code in predictable ways. You can then run these tests frequently against your code as it grows; any change to your code that breaks these tests can be quickly fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the ```unittest``` framework to perform these tests. This is much more efficient than creating your own testing scripts, but takes some getting used to. I suggest reading the documentation at https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html as a starting place, and learning to do some basic unit tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I were writing a machine learning code, I would write unittests for at least the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Giving it a path to a folder that doesn't exist or doesn't have data and check that it fails\n",
    "* Giving it imagery data of a different size than I expect and check that it fails\n",
    "* Feed imagery data of a size I *do* expect and check that the code succeeds\n",
    "* Check that the data loader is getting a size greater than zero (i.e. that it properly loads data)\n",
