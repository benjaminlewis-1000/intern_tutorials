    "\n",
    "To install a package that you know the name of (for instance, numpy), simply go to the command line and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we don't know the name of the package, so we need to search it. While Google is helpful, pip also includes a search function. Say I want to install OpenCV, the computer vision library, but I don't know the exact package name. I can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip search opencv\n",
    "```\n",
    "and among the results will be ```opencv-python```, which is the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of packages is straightforward (you may have to type a 'y' somewhere). Uninstalling a package can be done with\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall opencv-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a certain version, you can specify like this:\n",

    "To get a list of packages you have installed in your system or virtual environment, use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "which produces the file **requirements.txt**. You can also install a bunch of packages from a requirements file with\n",

    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing packages in your script\n",
    "Python scripts include the functionality of packages using the **import** keyword. Assuming that a package is in your path (most of the time, don't worry about this; pip will take care of it), you can import packages using the following. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",

    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "import matplotlib as matplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "Occasionally, you may want to go down in the heirarchy of the package to just include one part of it. For instance, you can import just the 'array' functionality of numpy with\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may occasionally see code from other people that **import**s the **\\*** function from a package, e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
