Slide 1
What is Git? 
-A Version control framework
- Industry standard
- Enables collaboration

Slide 2
Why use git
- Picture of non-version control (v1, v1_1, v_final, etc) -- may have different edit dates, lots of comments
- Act like a bookmark for code - you can checkpoint, develop more, etc.
- Work on multiple computers and with many people
- Complete copy of code resides on server and on all clients

Slide
-Uses: 
- code
- latex papers
- NOT FOR DATA, in general. Hundreds of MB every time you clone repo - not good. 
--Exceptions are not going to be used this summer, but there is a builtin for large file storage
- Not for binaries - doesn't know how to do diff (or at least, requires additional setup). Can store a binary, but it copies everything

Slide 
- Branching - why we would want to use that
- Graphic of branching
- Good practice: only stable code in 'master'. (We'll settle for just checking code in)
- Rebasing?

Slide
-Under the hood
- Store diffs between files

Slide
-.gitignore file
-.git/config
-Anything else in .git?

Slide
-GitLab/GitHub online
-See branches
-See files
-Other features of online?
-Creating a project
-Assigning collaborators
--What are the roles - developer, maintainer, etc. 

Slide
-Commands you need to know
-git branch
-git fetch
-git push
-git commit (-m)
-git push
-git pull
-git add (-A :/)
-git status   (xkcd comic)

Slide
-Setting up environment
-git config global user.name
-git config global user.email (something)
-git branch in shell?

Slide
-Working with remote storage 
-Pulling a repository (including from github)
-Setting up a remote (the instructions are given after creating it on GitLab)

Slide
-Hard and fast rules
--Pull before push
--git add, git commit, git push

Slide
-Merging
--I know how to do this in a text editor now (search for >>>>, =====, <<<< and edit accordingly.) It can also be done with a GUI tool, if you have it.  

Slide 
- Nice-to-have: branch tag in shell
- git manager for Windows (won't use in ATR Center, just know it's there)
- Git merge tools (todo: research)

Slide
-Further study:
--submodules (I don't know about this)

Slide
-2-3 web sites with good information
