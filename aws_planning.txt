AWS_USER=firstInitialLastName
VDL_email=Your_VDL_Email@vdl.com
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -C $VDL_email -f ~/.ssh/atrc17_$AWS_USER -q -N ""
Send public key, ~/.ssh/atrc17_$AWS_USER.pub, to your mentor.

(PuttyGen)
#####################

    If needed, download PuTTYgen from PuTTY download page. (PuTTYgen might have been installed previously with PuTTY)
    Launch the program
    Check to make sure type of key is RSA and number of bits is at least 4096
    Click the Generate button.
    Follow the instructions, Move mouse...
    Set Key Comment to “Your VDL email address”
    Enter a unique key passphrase in Key passphrase and Confirm passphrase fields. For additional information about using passphrases, see Log in with SSH Private Key on Windows.
    Save the public and private keys by clicking the Save Public Key and Save Private Key buttons. A good place is in your .ssh folder.
        Save the file with your ‘“User.Name” + “PublicAWSKey”’. Example:

            eboettcher_PublicAWSKey
            eboettcher_PrivateAWSKey

    Email your mentor your public key file so that it can be added to the AWS environment.
        You will receive a an address to connect to the AWS via SSH

            Dist “A” account: eboettcher@34.225.202.112
            Dist C account: eboettcher_C@11.123.11.1
