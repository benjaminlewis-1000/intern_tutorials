    "pip install numpy\n",

    "Sometimes, we don't know the name of the package, so we need to search it. While Google is helpful, pip also includes a search function. Say I want to install OpenCV, the computer vision library, but I don't know the exact package name. I can type:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "pip search opencv\n",

    "We often want to read or write to a text file. This is quite easy to do in Python. This is a basic example. More complicated examples allow you to append to a file, read or write the binary values in a file, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line ``with open('a.txt', 'w') as fh:`` is basically the same as ``fh = open('a.txt', 'w')``. Both of these open the file 'a.txt' as an object that can be written to, with the variable ``fh`` as the **file handle**. The difference is that the 'with' keyword makes it such that after the block is done, the file handle is closed. In general, the way that Python makes variables only valid within a certain context is called *scoping*, and is a good thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you'll see file I/O use the 'with' keyword. This is good practice, because it means that the file handle will automatically close after it's business is done. While Python is, in my experience, pretty robust if a file is closed before you want it to be closed, it's usually good practice to close a file that is open for writing so as to prevent data corruption. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'open' function is how we open files for reading and writing. The first argument is the file we want to act on, and the second one describes what you want to do. First, we will write a few lines to 'a.txt'. The 'w' option is for writing; there are other options as well, such as 'a' for append, 'x' to write a file that isn't there (it will fail if the file already exists), and modes for binary and text.

You can then run these tests frequently against your code as it grows; any change to your code that breaks these tests can be quickly fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the ```unittest``` framework to perform these tests. This is much more efficient than creating your own testing scripts, but takes some getting used to. I suggest reading the documentation at https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html as a starting place, and learning to do some basic unit tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I were writing a machine learning code, I would write unittests for at least the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Giving it a path to a folder that doesn't exist or doesn't have data and check that it fails\n",
    "* Giving it imagery data of a different size than I expect and check that it fails\n",
